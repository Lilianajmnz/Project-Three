# Project-Three

This project involved developing an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer to analyze daily transaction records and determine the frequency of purchased items. It helped the store optimize its produce layout based on customer demand.  

Strengths included aligning the program with client needs and guidelines, creating user-friendly functionality, and ensuring robust error handling. Potential enhancements could improve efficiency, security, and scalability, such as optimizing file processing and handling larger datasets.  

The most challenging part was creating a readable histogram for data visualization, which required careful formatting and debugging. Tools like online documentation and community resources were invaluable.  

Key transferable skills gained include modular code design, file I/O operations, and using data structures like maps for analysis. To ensure maintainability, the code was modular, well-documented, and followed consistent naming conventions for readability and adaptability.
